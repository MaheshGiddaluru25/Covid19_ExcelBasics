# Covid19_ExcelBasics

# Overview: 
You are an analyst and the government of india aims to understand the dynamics of COVID-19, focusing on the infection rates, mortality rates and recovery rates. Your task is to transform the dataset using different functions and functionalities different aspects in the later stages.

# Dataset:
•	State/UTs: Name of the states
•	Zone: This is a categorial column on the zones at which the state belongs to
•	Population: the total population of the particular state.
•	Active: Active COVID-19 cases in the particular state.
•	Discharged: the total discharged patients in the particular state.
•	Deaths: the total number of deaths in the particular state.

# Tasks to be performed:
1.	In the population column, use different CONDITIONAL FORMATTING feature to identify questions like which of the following states has the Highest/Lowest population?
2.	Using conditional formatting to determine the states which have the total COVID-19 cases on the higher side, helps us to understand the peak states which need to be focused.
3.	Create a column as Total cases using the SUM function to calculate the total COVID-19 cases. Calculate the total cases for one of the states and use the FLASH FILL AI feature in excel to fill column. keep the referencing in mind.
4.	Create a column as Active Ratio using the function in excel to calculate the ratio of active cases. Calculate the Active Ratio for one of the states and use the FLASH FILL AI feature in excel to fill the column.
5.	Create a column as Discharge Ratio using the function in excel to calculate the ratio of discharged cases. Calculate the Discharges Ratio for one of the states and use the FLASH FILL AI feature in excel to fill the column.
6.	Create a column as Death Ratio using the function in excel to calculate the ratio of Death cases. Calculate the Death Ratio for one of the states and use the FLASH FILL AI feature in excel to fill the column.
7.	Calculate the AVERAGE of the discharge Ratio column using the AVERAGE function in excel and create a separate column using IF function categorizing the discharge ratio into “Below Average” and “Above Average”. Also count the number of states which have above average discharge ratio using COUNTIF function.
8.	 Calculate the AVERAGE of the Death Ratio column using the AVERAGE function in excel and create a separate column using IF function categorizing the death ratio into “Below Average” and “Above Average”. Also count the number of states which have above average discharge ratio using COUNTIF function.
